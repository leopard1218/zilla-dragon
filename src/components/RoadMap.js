            <p>ZILLA is a token on the Ethereum blockchain, that is used as a utility token for the Bored Zilla Club collection. ZILLA tokenomics are built to reward holders weekly, simply for holding a Zilla. ZILLA tokens can be used to mutate your Zilla, and for in game purchases to build your Zilla&apos;s strength.</p>

            <p>One  of the utilities of ZILLA will be its mutation, in which a certain amount of ZILLA will be burned in exchange for MekaZillas. Traits of MekaZillas will be completely different, and will have their own collection. Mutating into a MekaZilla will require two Zillas and a hard-drive. Hard-drives will be available for purchase for a small amount of ZILLA.</p>

            <h3>PVP game development (Quarter 1 of 2022)</h3>
            <p>After minting has completed, we will begin the development of a PVP game. This game will allow Zillas to compete in a 2D Metaverse, where they will battle to see who the strongest Zilla is. There will be weekly tournaments where winners can earn ZILLA, and receive exclusive roles for their triumphs. Face off against fellow Zilla and MekaZilla holders and climb the ranks. Get weapons from the Weapon Shop to gain an advantage against others. Who can build the best squad and climb to the top of the ranks? Everyone starts at the bottom and slowly or rapidly gains ELO to get to the next rank. For further information about Weapon Shop and how to earn weapons check out our discord channel</p>
